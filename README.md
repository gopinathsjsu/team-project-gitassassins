## Extreme programming (XP) Core Values Implemented:
 * Communication
    * Communication was one of the key strengths of our team. Our team managed to meet every week on Tuesday and Friday for the scrum.
    * During the meeting, we discussed about individual progress, technical difficulties and we helped each other whenever there was a roadbloack. We ensured that there was knowledge transfer from one person to the rest of the team.
    * We used GITHUB project board to plan our product backlog items. This helped us to analyse our team's sprint capicity and plan accordingly for all our future sprints.
    * By incorporating unfettered communication, we eliminated major pitfalls at earlier stage of development and increased our overall productivity.

  * Simplicity
    * We ensured to incorporate only the simplest things that worked.
    * We have made our code modular and re-usable so that everyone in the team could understand the code and make changes in the future if needed.
    * We have minimised the code smells as much as possible and added relevant comments in our code.
    * Our code base is simple hence easy to maintain
  
  * Feedback
       * Constructive feedback gave us a healthy environment for interaction and conveying our thoughts more transparently.
       * By giving and receiving regular feedbacks, we were able learn, adapt to the changes and avoid recurring mistakes. This motivated us to perform more efficiently.
       * During the development phase we pushed our changes to our particular branch and created pull requests. Once the code was approved by another team member, we pushed the changes to the master branch. We made sure the code changes on the master branch was always stable and did not break the other team memberâ€™s code.
       * Continuous feedback helped us in aligning our goals and responsibilities.

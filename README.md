## XP Core Values
### Communication and Simplicity
The team has established effective communication among members. Each member gives updates on progress, next-steps and impediments during standups held twice a week. Daily progress can be tracked through the Sprint Task Sheet. The team clearly communicated the impediments they are facing and accepted suggestions from other team members.

We have kept our components modular and design simple so that it is easier to maintain, support, and revise.
